    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "We initially considered both U.S. census places and county subdivisions to generate the dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Places.** The raw dataset of U.S. places for 2020 is split into 56 files, each representing a \"concentration of population [... that] may or may not have legally prescribed limits, powers, or functions. This concentration of population must have a name, be locally recognized, and not be part of any other place\" ([Reference](https://www2.census.gov/geo/pdfs/reference/GARM/Ch9GARM.pdf)). There are 32,188 place(s) total spanning the 50 U.S. states, the District of Columbia, American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. In addition to the geometry column, relevant columns include the geography name (`NAME`) and computed name (`NAMELSAD`), which references the political subdivision (i.e., town, village, etc.). The dataset has a coordinate reference system (CRS) of EPSG:4269, which is standard for federal agencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "**County Subdivisions.** The U.S. Census Bureau defines county subdivisions as \"minor civil divisions (MCDs) or census county divisions (CCDs). A State has either MCDs or their statistical quivalents, or CCDs; it cannot contain both. [...] In the State of Alaska, whih has no counties and no MCDs, the Census Bureau and State officials have established census subareas (CSAs) as the statistical equivalents of MCDs\" ([Reference](https://www2.census.gov/geo/pdfs/reference/GARM/Ch8GARM.pdf)). This raw dataset of U.S. county subdivisions is also split into 56 files for the same geographic extent and contains 36,639 records and a CRS of EPSG:4269. Relevant columns include the geometry, name (`NAME`), and computed name (`NAMELSAD`).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we later determined that county subdivisions were more accurate representations of municipalities and only used that dataset for the pipeline."
