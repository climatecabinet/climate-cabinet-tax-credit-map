## Fossil Fuel Unemployment MSAs and Non-MSAs

**msa_nmsa_fee_ec_status_2023v2.zip.** A Shapefile of metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) and non-metropolitan statistical areas (non-MSAs) that meet up to two criteria: (1) having least one year since 2009, 0.17% or greater direct employment related to extraction, processing, transport, or storage of coal, oil, or natural gas (the fossil fuel employment (FFE) threshold) and (2) having an unemployment rate for 2022 that is equal to or greater than the national average unemployment rate for 2022. These MSAs and non-MSAs that meet both criteria are energy communities as of January 1, 2023, and will maintain that status until the unemployment rates for 2023 become available and a new list of energy communities is provided.
